# Solidity Smart Contract Example

## Simple Overview of Use/Purpose

This project demonstrates the use of `require()`, `assert()`, and `revert()` statements in a Solidity smart contract. The purpose is to showcase best practices for error handling and state validation within Ethereum smart contracts.

## Description

This Solidity project contains a smart contract named `ExampleContract`, which includes functions to set, increment, and reset a value. The contract also allows for ownership transfer. It utilizes `require()`, `assert()`, and `revert()` statements to ensure proper input validation, state consistency, and error handling. By following this example, developers can learn how to implement these essential Solidity features in their own contracts.

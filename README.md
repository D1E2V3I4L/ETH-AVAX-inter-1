# Error Handling in Solidity Smart Contract

## Simple Overview of Use/Purpose

This project demonstrates the use of `require()`, `assert()`, and `revert()` statements in a Solidity smart contract. The purpose is to showcase best practices for error handling and state validation within Ethereum smart contracts.

## Description

This Solidity project contains a smart contract named `ErrorHandling.sol`, which includes functions to set, increment, and reset a value. The contract also allows for ownership transfer. It utilizes `require()`, `assert()`, and `revert()` statements to ensure proper input validation, state consistency, and error handling. By following this example, developers can learn how to implement these essential Solidity features in their own contracts.

## Getting Started

### Running in Remix (remix.ethereum.org)

1. **Open Remix**: Go to [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/) in your web browser.

2. **Create a New File**: Click on the '+' icon in the file explorer on the left-hand side and create a new file named `ErrorHandling.sol`.

3. **Copy the Code**: Copy the code from `contracts/ErrorHandling.sol` in this repository and paste it into the newly created file in Remix.

4. **Compile the Contract**: In the Remix sidebar, navigate to the 'Solidity Compiler' tab. Select the appropriate compiler version (e.g., 0.8.0) and click the 'Compile ErrorHandling.sol' button to compile the contract.

5. **Deploy the Contract**:
   - Switch to the 'Deploy & run transactions' tab in Remix.
   - Ensure that the correct contract (`ErrorHandling`) is selected in the dropdown menu.
   - Click the 'Deploy' button to deploy the contract.

6. **Interact with the Contract**:
   - Once the contract is deployed, you can interact with it using the interface provided in Remix.
   - Each function in the contract can be called and tested by providing the required inputs and clicking the corresponding buttons (e.g., 'setValue', 'incrementValue', etc.).

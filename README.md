# ETH-AVAX-inter-1

# Solidity Smart Contract
#### This project demonstrates the use of require(), assert(), and revert() statements in a Solidity smart contract. The purpose is to showcase best practices for error handling and state validation within Ethereum smart contracts.

# Description
#### This Solidity project contains a smart contract named ErrorHandling, which includes functions to set, increment, and reset a value. The contract also allows for ownership transfer. It utilizes require(), assert(), and revert() statements to ensure proper input validation, state consistency, and error handling. By following this example, developers can learn how to implement these essential Solidity features in their own contracts.
